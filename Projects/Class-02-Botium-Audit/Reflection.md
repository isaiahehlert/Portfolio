# ðŸ§  Audit Reflection â€“ Botium Toys (Updated)

> This audit project was completed as part of my coursework for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I followed course materials, applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and used a structured internal audit scenario to evaluate risks, controls, and compliance gaps. The findings and recommendations are my own, based on an analysis of the fictional company Botium Toys.

### 1. What part of the audit process was most challenging for you?

The most challenging part was identifying and organizing missing controls by category and type. It required me to understand the purpose behind each control and evaluate real-world consequences of not having them in place, especially when interpreting complex risks like data encryption or backup failure.

### 2. What part of the audit process was most interesting?

Building the mitigation plan was the most interesting. It felt like real-world problem-solvingâ€”connecting risk to actual fixes. I enjoyed recommending control solutions that not only solve the problem but also align with compliance frameworks like PCI DSS and GDPR.

### 3. Which control category do you think is most important for this organization?

Administrative controls are crucial for Botium Toys. Without proper policies like access control, password management, and employee training, even the best technical tools wonâ€™t be used correctly. This company needs structure and standards to support their growing infrastructure.

### 4. How can this audit process be applied in a real-world organization?

This process mirrors how internal audits work in small businesses. It can be applied to evaluate control implementation, identify risk-prone areas, and ensure that regulatory requirements are being met. It also helps business owners understand the value of preventative security.

### 5. What did you learn from this activity?

I learned how to walk through an audit from beginning to end. I now feel more confident in identifying risks, categorizing controls, and writing professional audit documentation. This exercise gave me a hands-on perspective that connects theory to practice.
