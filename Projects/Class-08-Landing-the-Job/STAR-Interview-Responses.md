# üåü STAR Responses: Behavioral Interview Preparation

This document captures two fully-formed STAR responses (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to common behavioral interview questions for cybersecurity analyst roles.

## üíº Experiences That Demonstrate My Skills

- Created a custom man-in-the-middle proxy to intercept and mutate SHA-encrypted traffic for Apple Security Bounty testing.
- Built a portfolio of automated Python tools to analyze logs, sanitize sensitive data, and identify regex-matching attack patterns.
- Independently performed risk assessments and wrote internal audit reports using NIST-aligned control structures.

## ‚≠ê Question 1

**üß† Question:**  
*Describe an experience in which you used technical security tools as part of issue resolution. How did you assess the issues and reach the conclusion that these tools represented the optimal solution? What was the outcome?*

### Situation
While conducting security research for a bug bounty submission to Apple, I needed to inspect and mutate encrypted payloads being sent from an iOS device to Apple‚Äôs iCloud infrastructure.

### Task
My task was to determine if an attacker could alter synced data by manipulating requests in transit, and test whether Apple‚Äôs backend validation would detect or allow such tampering.

### Action
I set up a secure lab with a jailbroken iPhone and a Raspberry Pi MITM router. I deployed Frida and mitmproxy to hook into traffic between the Notes app and iCloud servers. I wrote custom Python scripts to intercept and mutate note contents, changing SHA values in real time to mimic tampering. I ensured proper TLS inspection and certificate pinning bypasses to make it viable.

### Result
My mutated payload successfully reached Apple‚Äôs iCloud backend, where I confirmed partial rehydration of forged data ‚Äî a significant step in demonstrating a sync-based logic flaw. I submitted my findings to Apple Security Bounty and received an acknowledgment within hours. The tools allowed me to prove a legitimate threat vector.

## ‚≠ê Question 2

**üß† Question:**  
*Think about a situation where you learned something new and unexpected about an important safety or security issue. What caught your attention and how did you learn about it? Describe what steps you took to understand the information better and learn more about this topic.*

### Situation
While reverse engineering app behavior for a security assessment, I discovered that Apple's TCC privacy protection database could be spoofed by cloning metadata from a trusted app into a fake one.

### Task
I needed to understand how macOS evaluated app trust for camera/microphone access, and whether an attacker could bypass this mechanism on an unmodified system.

### Action
I studied Apple‚Äôs TCC.db structure, macOS code signing policies, and sandbox inheritance behavior. I cloned a known-good app‚Äôs bundle metadata, modified the `Info.plist`, and used deep code signing to spoof its identity. I validated the exploit in a clean macOS environment and documented every step.

### Result
I successfully bypassed the TCC protection without SIP disablement or jailbreaking, and gained camera access using a fake app. This led to a formal bounty submission to Apple. I gained deeper expertise in privacy enforcement systems and now use this understanding to test and harden iOS/macOS applications more effectively.
