## 🧰 Lab: Home Asset Inventory

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Identify and classify assets connected to a home office network to understand their importance and sensitivity, aiding in effective asset management and risk assessment.

**Scenario:**  
Operating a small business from a home office, I cataloged network-connected devices such as desktop computers, smart devices, and storage hardware. This asset inventory serves as a core reference for securing sensitive data and ensuring operational continuity.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified three previously undocumented network-connected assets.
- Documented ownership, location, and network access characteristics.
- Analyzed risk exposure and sensitivity of each asset.
- Classified devices using standardized sensitivity categories: *Confidential*, *Restricted*, *Internal-only*, and *Public*.

## 🛡️ Lab: Risk Register Assessment

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Evaluate potential threats to a financial institution and assign risk scores based on likelihood and severity. Use a risk register to prioritize mitigation strategies and ensure compliance with operational and regulatory requirements.

**Scenario:**  
A commercial bank in a coastal region with strict financial regulations and a hybrid workforce conducted a risk assessment of its funds. Key risks included business email compromise, database exposure, and supply chain issues. The team assessed risk exposure using NIST’s risk calculation formula: *Likelihood × Severity = Priority*.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Assessed five financial risks to banking operations.
- Assigned likelihood and severity scores using a 1–3 scale.
- Calculated priority scores to rank the risks.
- Documented the rationale behind each threat score in a register.

## 🔒 Lab: Data Leak Risk Assessment

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the failure of least privilege controls following an internal data leak and recommend security control enhancements using NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 guidelines.

**Scenario:**  
A sales manager accidentally left internal-only documents shared with the team after a product meeting. A sales representative later sent the entire folder to an external partner who published the contents publicly. The breach was traced back to improper privilege revocation and poor access management.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Analyzed the breakdown of the least privilege principle.
- Reviewed NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 guidance on privilege enforcement.
- Recommended role-based access control and automatic privilege revocation.
- Justified solutions by highlighting prevention and damage control benefits.

## 🧩 Lab: Access Control Assessment

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Investigate an access control failure involving improper authentication or authorization, and recommend remediation strategies based on the security principle of **least privilege**.

**Scenario:**  
A user accessed sensitive resources using an account that should have been deactivated. The incident triggered a post-incident access control review to determine the scope, origin, and appropriate mitigation steps. This lab exercise documents threat details, identifies the access control issue, and recommends controls to prevent recurrence.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified **who** caused the incident, **when** it occurred, and **what device** was used.
- Determined the user’s **level of access** and whether the account should have been active.
- Applied **authorization and authentication** concepts to classify the failure.
- Recommended **technical and managerial controls** such as:
  - Enforcing **automated account deprovisioning**.
  - Conducting regular **access reviews**.
  - Implementing **multi-factor authentication** and **logging triggers** for privileged access.

## 🧮 Lab: Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Conduct a vulnerability assessment of a small business's public-facing database server to identify major risks, determine their likelihood and severity, and develop a remediation strategy aligned with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

**Scenario:**  
As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I discovered that the organization's database server had been exposed to the public internet since launch. The server, which stores and provides access to sensitive customer prospect data, was a prime target for external and internal threat actors. I evaluated the threat sources, estimated likelihood and severity of attacks, and proposed layered defenses to reduce exposure and ensure business continuity.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified top threats including exfiltration, DoS attacks, and insider data modification.
- Scored each threat based on **likelihood × severity = risk**.
- Documented rationale and assessment approach using qualitative analysis.
- Recommended controls like MFA, least privilege, encrypted connections, and intrusion detection.
- Used **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** to guide methodology and risk modeling.

## 🧲 Lab: Parking Lot USB Exercise

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Assess the risks of USB baiting attacks by analyzing the contents of a found USB drive, applying attacker mindset strategies, and proposing mitigation techniques to protect organizational systems.

**Scenario:**  
A USB stick branded with the hospital’s logo was found in the employee parking lot. After safely inspecting the device in a virtualized sandbox environment, the security team discovered a mix of personal photos and HR documents. The exercise focused on how such information could be exploited by threat actors and how to defend against similar baiting attacks.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified files containing personal and work-related data, including PII and shift schedules.
- Explored attack vectors like spear-phishing and malicious code delivery.
- Applied attacker mindset to map exploitation paths.
- Proposed mitigation techniques including port control, sandboxing, and staff training.
- Evaluated USB baiting risks using technical, operational, and managerial lenses.

## 🧠 Lab: PASTA Threat Modeling Worksheet

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Use the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework to assess the security risks of a new sneaker trading app before launch, identifying potential threats and recommending defenses.

**Scenario:**  
The company is preparing to launch a mobile app for buying and selling sneakers. As part of the growing security team, I conducted a full threat model using the seven stages of PASTA. I evaluated technical risks in SQL, encryption, and API layers; analyzed attacker tactics; and proposed defenses to reduce risk.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified business goals related to data privacy, payment handling, and user trust.
- Prioritized SQL security due to its role in storing sneaker and transaction data.
- Mapped external and internal threats including injection and insider misuse.
- Analyzed potential vulnerabilities in the codebase and encryption logic.
- Recommended controls such as input validation, MFA, secure TLS usage, and rate limiting.
