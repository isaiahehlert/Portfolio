# üß™ Parking Lot USB Exercise

This exercise explores the security risks and attacker perspectives involved in discovering a USB flash drive in a public setting. The analysis applies attacker mindset techniques and risk evaluation aligned with cybersecurity best practices.

## üìÅ Contents

The USB drive contains both personal and work-related files, including family and pet photos, a new hire letter, and an employee shift schedule. These files may contain personally identifiable information (PII) and internal hospital data. Storing personal and business files on the same device is risky, as it increases the chances of unauthorized access and data leaks.

## üß† Attacker Mindset

An attacker could use the personal photos and employee data to craft a spear-phishing campaign targeting Jorge or his colleagues. The files may have been planted deliberately to encourage someone to open the drive and unknowingly launch malicious software. Additionally, the employee schedule and HR documents could help an attacker map the hospital‚Äôs internal operations or impersonate staff.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analysis

USB drives are commonly used to deliver malicious software, including ransomware, keyloggers, and remote access trojans (RATs). If this drive were infected and opened by another employee, it could compromise the hospital‚Äôs systems or provide a foothold for a more advanced attack. Sensitive PII and internal documents could be extracted and used for identity theft or social engineering. To mitigate such risks, organizations should implement technical controls like USB port restrictions and endpoint detection, operational controls like mandatory USB scanning in sandboxed environments, and managerial policies like strict device handling protocols and employee training.
