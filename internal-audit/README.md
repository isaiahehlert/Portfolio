## ðŸ§¾ About This Project

This mock internal audit was conducted as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate coursework. The goal was to simulate a real-world audit experience by identifying potential security gaps, applying risk analysis, and documenting recommended mitigations. The audit focuses on aligning organizational practices with standard cybersecurity frameworks and control categories (administrative, technical, and physical).

Key stages of this audit include:
- Defining scope and goals
- Performing a structured risk assessment
- Identifying vulnerabilities
- Proposing a mitigation plan
- Communicating results to stakeholders

This project demonstrates the ability to apply audit processes and risk-based thinking in a cybersecurity context.
