# ðŸ§  Audit Reflection â€“ Botium Toys

> This audit project was completed as part of my coursework for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I followed the course readings and activities closely, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to guide the structure of my audit. I wrote each section based on what I learned in class, and used the provided scenario (Botium Toys) to apply the concepts in a realistic way. The process helped me practice identifying risks, categorizing controls, and documenting findings professionally.

### 1. What part of the audit process was most challenging for you?
Identifying specific risks and aligning them with the appropriate control categories and types was the most challenging. It required thinking like both a technician and a policy manager, which helped me realize how interdisciplinary cybersecurity truly is.

### 2. What part of the audit process was most interesting?
Creating the mitigation plan was the most interesting. It felt like real-world problem-solvingâ€”identifying gaps and strategically selecting fixes that balance cost, compliance, and effectiveness.

### 3. Which control category do you think is most important for this organization?
Administrative controls are critical at this stage. Botium Toys is growing fast, and clear policies, training, and role separation are necessary to reduce internal risk and build a sustainable security culture.

### 4. How can this audit process be applied in a real-world organization?
This exact processâ€”scope, assess, mitigate, reportâ€”is the foundation of security auditing. Any real-world company can use this format to prepare for external audits or improve internal controls proactively.

---

### 5. What did you learn from this activity?
I learned how to break down risk into manageable categories, communicate security concerns clearly, and build practical solutions based on best practices. It gave me confidence that I can handle entry-level audit and compliance tasks in a real job setting.
