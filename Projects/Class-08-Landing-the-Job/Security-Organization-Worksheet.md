2. **Vulnerability Research & Exploit Development**
3. **Bug Bounty & Responsible Disclosure Programs**

## üè¢ Part 2: Security Organizations & Their Objectives

### 1. **The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)**
A vulnerability disclosure program that rewards researchers for responsibly submitting bugs, especially critical zero-days. ZDI helps coordinate with vendors to patch issues and protect users.

### 2. **HackerOne**
A platform that connects ethical hackers with organizations (including Apple) through coordinated disclosure and bug bounty programs. It provides structure, legal safety, and global reach.

### 3. **OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)**
A nonprofit organization focused on improving software security through community-driven resources like the OWASP Top 10, development tools, and education.

## üîç Part 3: Best Fit and Why

- **ZDI** and **HackerOne** directly support my interest in vulnerability discovery and Apple product security.
- **OWASP** is educationally valuable but less applicable to live bounty and exploit work.

**‚úÖ Best Fit: HackerOne**  
HackerOne most closely matches my current focus. I actively engage in bug bounty work targeting Apple systems, and HackerOne provides a structured, legitimate platform for responsible disclosure and recognition.
