## üñ•Ô∏è System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment covers a period of three months. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the security posture of the company‚Äôs publicly accessible database server, which plays a critical role in storing and retrieving customer data. Because employees frequently query this server to access potential client information, its integrity and availability are essential to business operations. An open and unprotected server significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential disruption of services. This assessment aims to identify the associated risks and provide actionable recommendations to secure the server in alignment with the company's operational goals and security best practices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

| Threat Source        | Threat Event                                      | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Score |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Hacker (Outsider)    | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration     | 3          | 3        | 9          |
| Competitor           | Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attack            | 2          | 3        | 6          |
| Privileged Insider   | Alter/Delete critical information                 | 2          | 3        | 6          |

## üß† Approach

To evaluate the risks to the company‚Äôs exposed database server, I selected threat sources that represent both external and internal actors with the capability and motivation to exploit the system. Hackers are a high-priority threat due to the server‚Äôs public exposure, making exfiltration of sensitive data highly likely and impactful. Competitors could launch DoS attacks to disrupt business operations and cause revenue loss. Finally, privileged insiders, whether malicious or careless, could alter or delete critical data. These risks were selected due to their high potential to interrupt business continuity and harm customer trust.

## üõ°Ô∏è Remediation Strategy

To reduce risk, the company should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls, ensuring only authorized users can interact with the database. Applying the principle of least privilege will limit exposure if internal credentials are compromised. A layered defense (defense in depth) strategy, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and encrypted communication (SSL/TLS), can help mitigate external threats. Logging and monitoring tools should be deployed to detect unauthorized access or anomalous behavior. These measures collectively enhance the system‚Äôs resilience and align with NIST-recommended best practices.
