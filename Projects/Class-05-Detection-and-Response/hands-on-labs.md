# ðŸ§ª Hands-On Labs â€“ Class 5: Detection and Response

This section contains summaries and artifacts from the hands-on labs completed in **Course 5** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These labs focus on **monitoring, detection, and incident response**, using tools like **SIEMs (e.g., Splunk)** to investigate threats, filter event logs, and identify suspicious activity across assets and users.

## ðŸ§° Lab: Home Asset Inventory

**Course:**  
Google Cybersecurity Certificate â€“ Class 05: Detection and Response

**Objective:**  
Identify and classify assets connected to a home office network to understand their importance and sensitivity, aiding in effective asset management and risk assessment.

**Scenario:**  
Operating a small business from a home office, I cataloged network-connected devices such as desktop computers, smart devices, and storage hardware. This asset inventory serves as a core reference for securing sensitive data and ensuring operational continuity.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Identified three previously undocumented network-connected assets.
- Documented ownership, location, and network access characteristics.
- Analyzed risk exposure and sensitivity of each asset.
- Classified devices using standardized sensitivity categories: *Confidential*, *Restricted*, *Internal-only*, and *Public*.

**Deliverable:**
