# 🧪 Hands-On Labs – Class 4: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL

This section contains summaries and artifacts from the hands-on labs completed in **Course 4** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These labs develop core skills in **Linux command-line operations** and **SQL-based log analysis**.

## 🐧 **Linux Command Line Lab: Authorization and Permissions**

In this lab, I managed file and directory permissions using Linux commands. The scenario involved a sensitive research environment where I was responsible for removing unauthorized access and aligning permission settings with company security policy.

### Key Actions:
- Used `ls -la` to audit permission settings, including hidden files.
- Interpreted 10-character permission strings (e.g., `-rw-rw-r--`) to determine access levels.
- Applied `chmod` to restrict or grant permissions appropriately for user, group, and others.
- Updated a hidden file (`.project_x.txt`) to make it read-only.
- Removed execute access from a sensitive directory (`drafts`) for non-owner users.

## 🧮 **SQL for Cybersecurity Lab**

This lab (TBD) focuses on using SQL to extract and filter data from relational databases. You’ll learn to write basic and intermediate queries used in cybersecurity investigations, such as searching login anomalies or filtering event logs by timestamp.

📄 *Lab report and template links will be added upon completion.*
