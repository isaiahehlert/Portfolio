# üêç Automate Cybersecurity Tasks With Python

**Class 07 ‚Äì Google Cybersecurity Certificate**

In this class, I will learn how to use **Python** to automate common cybersecurity tasks. These include:

- Parsing log files for security events  
- Using regular expressions to extract patterns  
- Writing Python scripts to detect suspicious activity  
- Automating parts of the incident response process  

Python is widely used in cybersecurity because it's simple, flexible, and powerful. I'll use it to explore how automation can help identify threats faster and reduce human error.
