## 🧠 Additional Notes  
This case highlights the importance of phishing awareness training and multi-layered email filtering. I would like to know whether this clinic had a documented incident response plan and data backups. Follow-up actions should include forensic analysis, legal compliance (HIPAA), and post-incident user training.
