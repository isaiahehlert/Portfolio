## 📁 Lab 1: Research Network Protocol Analyzers

**🎯 Objective:**  
Compare two widely used packet analysis tools—**Wireshark** and **tcpdump**—to understand their strengths, interfaces, and practical use in cybersecurity investigations.

**📝 Summary:**  
Students analyze how Wireshark provides a GUI-based deep inspection environment, while tcpdump offers a lightweight command-line interface for efficient and remote captures. This lab reinforces packet-level visibility and filtering logic using real `.pcap` data.

**🛠️ Skills Gained:**  
- Use of **Wireshark** for visual inspection of packet structures  
- Use of **tcpdump** for CLI-based packet capture and filtering  
- Understanding protocol layers and packet dissection  
- Documentation of tool comparisons for forensic use

## 📁 Lab 2: Document Incident with Incident Handler’s Journal

**🎯 Objective:**  
Simulate a security analyst’s role in documenting a ransomware incident using a structured incident handler's journal template aligned with NIST guidelines.

**📝 Summary:**  
In this lab, a fictional healthcare clinic is targeted by ransomware via a phishing attack. The student documents the timeline, cause, and impact using the 5 W's method and additional reflection—developing habits essential to real-world incident response.

**🛠️ Skills Gained:**  
- Documentation using **incident handler’s journal**  
- Analysis of attack origin, methods, and impact  
- Use of **NIST incident response phases** in context  
- Communication and reporting fundamentals
