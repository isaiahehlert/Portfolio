## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch

Hi, I’m Isaiah Ehlert—a security researcher and red team operator in training, focused on breaking things with purpose.

I’m building real-world tools that parse encrypted traffic, mutate payloads, and simulate adversarial behavior—all with integrity and precision. Through my Apple Security Bounty submissions and hands-on GitHub projects, I’ve proven that I can identify, exploit, and report security flaws at a professional level.

I’m drawn to companies like CrowdStrike because they value speed, boldness, and clarity of mission. I’m ready to contribute to a team that defends by thinking like an attacker—and I’ve already begun.
