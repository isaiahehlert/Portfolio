# 🧪 Hands-On Labs – Class 6: Detection and Response

This section contains summaries and artifacts from the hands-on labs completed in **Course 6** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These labs focus on real-world skills for identifying, investigating, and responding to security incidents using tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, and incident handler documentation techniques.

## 📁 Lab 1: Research Network Protocol Analyzers

**Objective:**  
Compare the functionality and use cases of Wireshark and tcpdump, two essential network protocol analyzers used in incident detection and response.

**Summary:**  
Students explore the differences between a graphical packet inspection tool (Wireshark) and a command-line alternative (tcpdump). Key aspects of live packet capture, protocol filtering, and output interpretation are examined.

**Skills Gained:**  
- Understand GUI vs. CLI packet capture environments  
- Filter traffic using tcpdump BPF syntax and Wireshark display filters  
- Identify protocol layers in captured packets  
- Document comparative analysis of network forensics tools

## 📁 Lab 2: Document Incident with Incident Handler’s Journal

**Objective:**  
Simulate the response to a healthcare-based ransomware attack and document findings using a formal incident handler’s journal.

**Summary:**  
This lab introduces a scenario involving a phishing-based ransomware attack against a small clinic. The student assumes the role of a security analyst documenting the event using a structured NIST-style incident response format.

**Skills Gained:**  
- Record the 5 W’s of an incident (Who, What, When, Where, Why)  
- Practice incident response documentation  
- Evaluate threat vectors (phishing, ransomware)  
- Assess impact and communication strategy
