# Professional Statement

I am an adaptable and mission-driven cybersecurity professional-in-training with a background in high-risk, high-accountability environments. I value integrity, continuous learning, and ethical responsibility in securing digital systems. I’m building strong skills in Python, cybersecurity automation, and digital forensics to help organizations identify threats, reduce risk, and protect sensitive data across networks and infrastructures.
